I created a chatbot on Whatsapp using OpenAl's and Google Gemini's models to generate responses to
users on Whatsapp using Flask and Twilio.
## Project Overview
- Set up the Flask web server to handle incoming requests from Twilio by integrating OpenAl/ Gemini Pro
- Used Twilio API to manage WhatsApp messages, sending them to OpenAI or Google Gemini API for
processing.
- Used Ngrok to expose the local Flask server to the internet, allowing Twilio to route messages to it
enabling the bot to receive, process, and respond to WhatsApp messages in real-time.
## Tools and Technologies Used
Python, OpenAl, Google Gemini, Twilio(PaS), Flask, Ngrok
